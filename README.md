# xCommerce

## Project Description

xCommerce is my personal project designed as a visual clone of the existing online store x-kom.pl. The goal of this initiative is to develop my skills in handling complex projects and to practice creating clear, well-organized code. Utilizing a monorepo allows for the separation of the dashboard and the store page, facilitating efficient management of the component library and common tools.

- **Next.js** - A React framework that enables server-side rendering and static website generation.
- **TypeScript** - A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing.
- **Tailwind CSS** - A CSS framework that allows for quick construction of responsive interfaces.
- **Turborepo** - A tool for managing multiple packages within a monorepo.
