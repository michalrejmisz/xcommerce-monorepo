# xCommerce

## Deployment

- **Dashboard** is deployed at [xCommerce Dashboard](https://xcommerce-six.vercel.app/)
- **Storefront** is deployed at [xCommerce Storefront](https://xcommerce-storefront.vercel.app/)

## Project Description

xCommerce is my personal project designed as a visual clone of the existing online store x-kom.pl. The goal of this initiative is to develop my skills in handling complex projects and to practice creating clear, well-organized code. Utilizing a monorepo allows for the separation of the dashboard and the store page, facilitating efficient management of the component library and common tools.
